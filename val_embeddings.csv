1;When I was the chairman of a student organisation, there was some friction between two board members in the organisation. Conflict among peers is something I really struggle with, especially in situations as this one. Since I was the chairman, I had to remain neutral on the one hand, while on the other hand also making this conflict does not remain unresolved. Because of this friction, I had decided to conduct a small informal meeting in which both members could talk things out and I had to moderate their conversation. As a result of this conversation, both members could see eye to eye again and the fiction did not expand into something worse. This was one of the first times in which I had to moderate a discussion between two friends and both were relieved that I took the time to focus on their well-being.;I learned one of the most important lessons in management because of a mistake I made. As a chairman, you often have to deal with unexpected challenges. One time, another board member had made a mistake which resulted in us having to postpone an event. This person did not fit in very well in the group and I did not want to ostracize them any further, so I decided to make up another excuse, because of which the event could continue as planned. Later on, other board members had found out why the event had to be cancelled and that I had kept the real reason a secret from them. Even though the other members appreciated and understood why I hesitated to tell them, they made sure to let me know that I should always be honest with them and I had to apologise. Because of this, I learned that honesty and openness are key values in managing an organisation, even if you are afraid to do so.

2;I am leader and group-leader in scouts. This means a lot of responsibility falls upon me and when issues present I have to find solutions. Once, there was quite a big miscommunication issue with the money we ask parents for summer camp. Some co-leaders had sent an unfinished draft of the camp invitation to the parents, in which the price for camp was way too low. This resulted in plenty of parents not paying enough. The leaders in this situation only realized their mistake when camp was already on its way, and they did not have enough money to provide food for the entire camp. They contacted me with the question of what they should do. Of course, it is annoying to ask parents for more money when they have already sent their kids to us. Communication with parents had never been a strong skill of mine, but now I had no choice but to contact them all with a difficult question. I decided the best we could do was own up our mistake, show the parents we would try and solve it ourselves but also let them know that they could still help. We crafted some baskets with snacks and crafts with the kids and went to sell them on the streets close to our camp location, but also let the parents know they could reserve some for after camp was over. They would pay in advance, and get the basket upon return of their kids. This way, we did not have to straight up ask more money from the parents, but gave them something in return and also made it into something fun for the kids.;When I failed my first exam, I felt like giving up. In high school I was not used to failing and always got pretty solid grades. When I came to university, my first exam period I failed one exam. Everyone told me that it was okay, it happens to everyone, there is no shame. However, I was very disappointed in myself and felt like I really did not try hard enough. It made me doubt whether I made the correct choice of study. When the second semester started, though, the fear to feel like this again boosted me to work harder. It forced me to learn how to study, and it gave me new motivation. I learned that failure can slow me down and make me want to quit, but I can also change the mindset around it and have it give me a boost.;For this I would go back to scouts. Last year a lot of my friends quit and a lot of new people became leader. Two groups formed itself. The people who had been leaders a while and who were closest with the ones who just quit, and the people who just became a scoutsleader and did not have any connection yet to the already-leaders. My job as head leader was to bring them together. I tried organizing teambuildings and invited all of them for drinks a couple of times. However, the people of a group would always sit together and have their own conversations. Eventually I decided to organize a BBQ at our scouts, and I put namecards for everyone on a chair. It forced them to sit next to people they did not really know and forced them to find things to talk about, otherwise it would be a boring BBQ. The BBQ was a success, they all talked, new friend groups were forming and now, a year later, you cannot see the two separate groups anymore.;0.67;0.09;0.73;0.9;0.61;74.0;I am leader and group-leader in scouts.

3;I was given a project to lead a commercial execution of integrating two air networks. I had to layout the project in a way to agree all stakeholders on the desired end state and as well to map out how to get there, including all the risks along the way. I had done that, and mapped known risks but along the way i faced unknown risks which jeopradized the project. I had escalated timely, asked for more resources and developed workarounds. I used agile approach and was able to showcase on the base of my work what is the cost of deviation against plan and not reaching the desired end state.;In a retail company i was given a task to redefine space allocated on the basis of data analytics. I had done extensive modeling and developed an approach which C-suite approved. I had launched the project only to be informed on the weekend by handyman that i had neglected to look at bearing walls and my model allocated space where it would not be possible to do so. Afte so much work I was devastated, I went to see it and talked to handyman who gave me great options. We fixed it together, i learned that stakeholders are everybody who work in a company, I learned to listen to solutions, and learned not to trust data 100 percent.;I was asked to lead a team as interim manager. I worked with a group of indviduals, and we established a weekly cadence to look into projects they were doing and how I could support them. After a while i noticed some projects were doing great while some people stopped working. I talked to indviduals, offered help, but it did not work and eventually people complained about me. I learned to pick my battles, and work more with emotional intelligence. Also I learned some people are not motivated and it is unfixable if you cannot hold them accountable.

4;I have been presented with many situations that put me outside of my comfort zone while living abroad. One of it's key aspects is the inevitable confrontation with language conflict.

These situations have made me more adaptable, more receptive to what words and explanations are more easily understood. One of the ways to overcome this barrier was getting to know the key cultural concepts or elements that people from a specific country/region/city know, may it be a specific word, a song, a movie, a saying, random fact about the local football team - all these things seem to create a connection, as it shows that you care and are curious about the people surrounding you.;I have recently started volunteering at a cultural center in which my tasks include bartending.

Even when I applied for this position I knew that I will inevitably makes mistakes, just as one always does when starting a new thing. During my first shifts, I miscalculated prices, poured drinks to the wrong cups, had to deal with foamy and fussy beers and had to learn how to deal with less satisfied visitors.This experience, together with many other volunteering opportunities that I had done in the past, mainly taught to not be afraid of making mistakes, as it is the only way to learn. Additionally, I have noticed is that in such instances, I always have to slow myself down, calm my mind and pay attention to what I am doing, this way not letting the stress in and helping me learn and perform better.

5;For a long time I did not like presenting papers in front of an audience. This was something that made me very nervous and uncomfortable. When starting my PhD this of course was a crucial part of how to share research with peers. So I really had to come outside my comfort zone. I tried to overcome my nerves for this by prepping very thoroughly in advance. In the notes section of the powerpoint slides I wrote out word for word what I wanted to say. Once I had my text I practiced it out loud multiple times over to know most of it by hart and to sound fluent in what I wanted to say. This made me a little bit more secure and a little bit less nervous. After going through this routine, I now almost feel not nervous at all anymore.;When I send in an article that I had written for an academic journal, the feedback was that it was not accepted in its current form. So for me this felt like I failed. The reviewers of the journal are very strict. The feedback I got was critical but very elaborate. With some of the feedback I agreed, with other parts I found the reviewers were nagging about little thinks or made mistakes themselves. To tackle the problem I asked for an extended deadline and continued working on the article to make it better and process all the different feedback I got. In the end the article was accepted though I still need to make some very small changes. I learned from this experience that sometimes getting an article published can be difficult, at other times it goes more smoothly. I also learned it is important to persevere even when something is difficult. And that also the reviewers themselves are not flawless and made unnecessary comments at times.;My grandparents like to spend time with their grandchildren but do not see them often. To make possible a walk where all grandchildren would be present I set up a chat-group with a poll, to see when everyone had some free time. After some time everyone filled it in and we decided on the best date to do a walk. When the day arrived one person was not able to show up, which was very unfortunate. The issues related mainly to people taking a while in answering the poll not very quickly. The fact that some people did not show up, has to do with the priorities they set, and this is not something that I could solve to letting everyone come together. The end results was that my grandparents were happy to see most of their grandchildren and my nieces and nephews were thankful I took it upon me to organize this.;0.42;0.09;0.01;0.9;0.28;98.0;For a long time I did not like presenting papers in front of an audience.

6;Last year, I saw a limping horse on a field next to my home. I observed the horse for a while and saw that it was in a lot of pain. However, I knew that the people who owned the horse did not live closeby, but I also did not know who these people were or where they lived. I was faced with the issue of having to find help without knowing where to start. I decided to phone a veterinary doctor from my village and asked if he knew the people who owned the horse. He told me he did not, but he did know the previous owners of the field. That way I was able to call several people and eventually found the owner. The horse was brought to the veterinary doctor that same day. I could have given up immediately because I did not know the owners, and most people I called could not directly help me. Instead, I decided to take the time out of my day to truly look for help and eventually succeeded in my endeavours. From this experience, I learned that even problems that initially look impossible to solve can always be solved step by step, with a lot of time and effort.;Before exams, I always try to rigorously plan my study time in order to study all of the available material. However, last year, the subject matter of one of my exams was completely new for me, and I realised that I did not foresee enough time to study for this exam at all. Since I also needed time to study for other exams, I had to find a way to study as much as possible without being able to study everything by heart. Since I attended all of my classes, some of the subject matter was already quite clear to me, but there were some parts that remained difficult. Therefore, I decided it would be best to dedicate as much time as possible to thoroughly understanding the parts I was struggling with, and to spend little time on the parts I felt more comfortable with, trusting I would remember what I needed from my classes. I went to the exam without studying or understanding everything I needed to. Nevertheless, I was able to pass the exam by taking the risk of only focusing on the parts I did not understand, and by believing in myself for the other parts. This has made me realise that, even in situations where you are not fully in control, you can always fall back on the knowledge that you already have and trust that you will be able to overcome the situation to the best of your ability.;In my third year at university, I was assigned into a group for a project with a Spanish international student and a working student. However, we quickly realised that our educational backgrounds differed a lot, which negatively impacted how we worked together. After realising this and with a deadline quickly approaching, I asked my group members to come together to discuss how we could solve our problems. We found that we all had very different talents when it came to doing academic research, but combining these talents we could come to a nice end product. For instance, the working student had a talent for Excel, from his experience in the workfield. He took it upon himself to do the necessary calculations for our research. The international student was good at presenting, so she took on a larger part of the presentation. While I do not like presenting, I do enjoy doing the research for and writing essays. Therefore, I focused mostly on the essay that we needed to hand in before our presentation.

8;Once I was part of a church choir project and was asked whether I wanted to sing a solo part. I was by far the youngest singer and it was my first time participating. Of course this offer was a great honour and I decided to accept. However, I felt like the demands exceeded my abilities since I had no prior experience. Therefore, I felt anxiety growing with the concert approaching. It was two things that helped me: First of all, I set priorities and focused on specific parts in each piece that I practiced thoroughly, trusting myself that I would somehow manage to improvise the rest. And even if those partially neglected parts were not perfect, there would still be the practiced parts. Secondly, I accepted my status as a complete beginner and took it more as a challenge for myself than a duty to perform for others. Rationally, I was aware nobody would be mad at me for not delivering a perfect performance. Indeed, the day of the concert came and I messed up countless times. Nevertheless, I was able to enjoy the amazing music and I managed to produce and experience some beautiful and memorable moments.;I once caused a small accident with a rental car while moving to a new apartment. Nobody was hurt, it was only a small scratch on the rear light. I panicked, and hoping it would go unnoticed, I parked the car and left. A day later I was confronted by the company and initially denied the obviously correct accusation. When I was confronted with evidence of my wrongdoing, I felt ashamed like never before. I had remained in passive inaction until there was no way out. Additionally to the relatively cheap repair, I had to pay a very expensive investigation fee. Still, the money was nothing compared to the harm done to my self-image. I regret to this day that I lied instead of just admitting to the excusable mistake I made. I decided to never again risk being caught in a wrongdoing and instead to be honest from the start.;I once organized a big party at our house with my flatmate and had several of my friend help me for several things like buying stuff, decorating, cleaning and cooking. It was a relatively stressful experience, since I could not get rid of a heavy sense of responsibility, even when the party started. I can't really pinpoint what it was that made me so anxious, since all of my friends were quite reliable. I think it was the challenge of thinking about multiple things at once, setting priorities and fear of forgetting something. The party itself was a great experience for everyone, but I wish I could have freed myself of the anxiety.;0.9;0.03;0.83;0.9;0.28;74.0;Once I was part of a church choir project and was asked whether I wanted to sing a solo part.

9;I work a student job at a catering company. One time, unexpectedly, my boss was absent, so I had to take on his leading role of managing the kitchen and communicating with whoever commissioned the reception. This was obviously too much for a single person to handle, but in the end I managed to make everything run smoothly by focusing on efficiency. Instead of running errands for everyone, I told the commissioner and the kitchen staff to come to me with every need or problem, which made it easier to keep track of all the timings. After hearing about this, my boss now applies the same strategy.;As a hobby I play a competitive card game. Usually I am well prepared for tournaments, as was the same for my first ever big tournament. The night before, I panicked, not believing in the deck I chose and started neurotically messaging all my friends for advice. I ended up making a bunch of changes to my deck, which were suboptimal changes to begin with, which resulted in me not knowing the deck I was piloting, and making unfortunate mistakes throughout the entire day. All my prep was thrown into the water the night before just because of my mental state. I learned to trust my own judgements and to be confident in my abilities.;Building on my answer to question 1, I now frequently have to take on a more managerial role at my student job. One time, I was put in charge of a group of fellow students for a big event. I became focused on figuring out everyone's strengths and needs, to optimally assign each of them a role. I tried messaging each one beforehand, which surprisingly didn't turn out to be a success. I barely got any replies. So, the night before, I busted out my notepad to make a comprehensive list of everyone's strengths, weaknesses, and possible pairings.

10;I have a part-time job as the manager of an escape room. I am confronted with problems outside of my comfort zone almost daily. For example, customers put a cable inside a power outlet, thinking it was a puzzle they needed to solve, but this caused a blackout of the entire venue. I had to quickly resolve this issue because there were other customers playing other games. Thankfully, I got the power running again in under 10 minutes so the other customers did not really notice the power outage (We said it was a glitch in the game). By having to resolve these kinds of issues outside of my comfort zone almost daily, I believe I have become quite stress resistant in these types situations.;When I was 15, I had a part-time job as a sales assistant in a bakery. That day, I was very disorganised and chaotic due to a lack of sleep and having to wake up at 5 that morning to go to work. I remember a customer placing an order with me which she would pick up the following week. I took the order, she payed, and I thought I did a great job. The next week I was working when this customer came to collect her order. She was quite shocked to see a huge bag with 50 rolls (pistolets in Dutch) when she had order only 5 rolls the week before. I realised I had made a huge mistake when I was filling out the order form. I apologised and luckily she thought my mistake was quite funny. I sent her home with an extra pastry and the money she payed for those 50 rolls and I went home with 45 rolls.;I have a part-time job as the manager of an escape room. As manager, I have many different responsibilities. I think my main responsibility is leading the group of student working at the escape room. There are 7 games in the venue, fit for a total of about 60 people. Whenever there are such large groups of customers, I try to be present to help my students when necessary. They depend on me to tell them what to do when there are a lot of customers as it is a stressful situation. They feel more comfortable when I give them specific tasks and tell them to work together on a certain group or game. I don't often encounter issues when telling the students to work together, because we all get along quite well and like to do tasks in teams. Whenever I help them, it results in less stress for the students and better customer service.;0.56;0.94;0.73;0.9;0.4;60.0;I have a part-time job as the manager of an escape room.

11;I was doing a project for my college where I was supposed to interview people to collect data for my social project. Talking to new people, let alone interview strangers is out of my comfort zone. Something I don't do it at all. Since the project didn't specify the nature of the interview and interviewing people physically is something outside my comfort zone, I made an online survey and posted in several online forums. It resulted in having wide range of responses considering the amount of people responding to the interview as well is quite huge which is quite limiting when it comes to conducting physical, face to face interview.;I was always passionate about learning martial arts. So I took classes on Tai chi, which is a slowest and gentlest form of martial art but requires lot of control. There was a tournament on it within a few months of attending classes. And I wanted to participate and win the tournament. I was over confident. However, since I only practised for months learning all steps, I don't have enough practise mastering the Tai chi. Despite being advised against participating by my instructor I participated and lost very quickly. This experience taught me to be never be overconfident in something I never learned fully and always be sure of your skill level in the things you have learned.;It was an assignment in college where we have to work together in groups. So I formed the group with my friends and some other classmate. Soon a member in my group turned out to be problematic and refuses to contribute to the portion of the work she was supposed to do. We have tried making her working on her part, although she always says she will be doing it always ended up coming with excuses. We ended up doing her work and reported her to professor since she didn't do her part.

12;Last year, I volunteered to tutor a group of four students at a secondary school in Antwerp. It was my first time tutoring, and the students came from different classes and had different learning needs, so I prepared well. Since it was the first session, I made a welcome game that would help the students get to know me and each other a bit more. When I arrived at the school, however, only one of the students was present. Because it suddenly became a one-on-one session, I could no longer rely on the icebreaker game to fill the session. Despite my initial worries, I got to know the student through spontaneous conversation and helped her with some questions she had about an upcoming test. I learned that, even in situations where I am thoroughly prepared, unexpected situations can arise and it is important to be able to handle them on the spot.;In the second semester of my first year at university, I had a very busy exam period with not enough time to prepare for all of my exams. One exam in particular required us to learn a lot of material in a short period of time. Because I am quite perfectionistic and I wanted to achieve a high grade, I started learning the first part of the material in great detail. This took longer than expected, and as a result, I did not have enough time left to study the second part of the material in the same thorough way. In the end, the exam questions mostly focussed on the second part of the course, so I ended up getting a grade that I was not satisfied with. I realised that instead of wanting to study the material perfectly, it was more important to first approach the material in a broad way and only focus on learning the details later. Despite the disappointing grade for that exam, the experience helped me adjust my study attitude and helped me achieve better grades in later exam periods.;For an elective course that I took at university, I was required to write a group paper with six other students. The students were all from different disciplines and faculties, and not everyone could come to class due to their class schedules. This made it challenging to work together, especially since meeting up in person was difficult. We made a group chat to discuss how we would handle writing the group paper and we divided the tasks amongst ourselves. I learned that it was important to take the lead and to make suggestions to my group mates, even though I was sometimes a bit shy because I had not directly met any of them. It also helped to regularly check up with my group mates and how their work progressed, since some of them were not very responsive and delayed working on the assignment. Even though working in such a large group was challenging, I was satisfied with our experience of working together and we received a good grade for our paper.;1.0;0.94;0.09;0.9;0.4;100.0;Last year, I volunteered to tutor a group of four students at a secondary school in Antwerp.

13;To preface this story I'll first share a bit of context: For my bachelors degree I studied abroad in China for about 11 months, in combination with doing my internship for my masters there as well. When we first arrived it quickly became clear my Chinese was slightly stinted and more or less insufficient to survive the administrative horrors of moving across continents. The first arduous task was to open a bank account. None of the admin personnel at our host university knew English but we quickly figured out we would need to first apply for a Chinese phone number. I decided to ask other international students for help and managed to find a Russian girl who spoke some English who also didn't know how to solve our problem. Together we ended up searching for a Chinese teacher who spoke Russian so we could ask the student to translate our questions to her. All of us ended up going to the bank together and succesfully opened a bank account despite the language barriers.;This story is quite a silly one, but i feel it showcases some of my irritating character flaws, so I'll share it anyway. I work part-time as a waiter in a wedding venue. It's hard work and I'm often there until fairly late at night. One such night I was truly exhausted and had an early morning class the day after. Most of our closing tasks had been done and it was finally almost time to go home when I dropped a full rack of glasses in my fatigued rush to get home quickly.  Had I taken my time to see it through patiently OR decided not tot spread myself as thin this mistake could've been easily avoided.;I was on the board as secretary (and later HR officer) of a student association for quite some time. We organised multiple activities every month with a relatively minor budget, which was quite stressful at times. The largest issues we encountered, however, were interpersonal ones: many of our team truly struggled to work together because of everything from useless drama to clashing personalities. It often irritated me greatly that others lacked the maturity to put aside personal differences to work together as a team, but then realised irritation is not the best headspace to approach that from. I quickly learned an understanding an compassionate attitude, while way more effort, gets better results. It has always and probably will always be easier for me to work together with people with similar mindsets to me, but nowadays I'm quite good at feigning whatever I need to get a decent end result. In the end we had many succesful activities and our association truly made a lot of connections possible between members.;0.79;0.03;0.73;0.37;0.13;11.0;To preface this story I'll first share a bit of context: For my bachelors degree I studied abroad in China for about 11 months, in combination with doing my internship for my masters there as well.

18;Passing through Lyon on an interrail trip with two friends, we spent the night in a hostel. Coming back at night exhausted, we discovered that one of the other beds in the dormitory was taken by an unfresh looking man with a pair of feet hanging over the edge of the bed which smelled unlike anything I had smelled before. One of us, quite sensitive to smells, had to run to the toilet to puke after having entered the dormitory. It was impossible for him to sleep there (and the rest of us didn't want to) so we went to the receptionist to ask if he had other beds available. It was then that things started to escalate. The receptionist took great responsibility when he heard our story and went up to the dormitory to ask the man to leave. The man, of course, refused. There was a dispute and the receptionist called the police. The police came, but they couldn't do much, because this man didn't do anything wrong, he just had smelly feet, and he still refused to leave. There was nothing else to do but to return to the room embarrassed. Our lucky sensitive friend got one of the last beds in a girls only dormitory, but we had to confront this man who looked ready to slit our throats. It gave me the chills and in a desperate move I took a fresh pair of socks from my luggage and offered them to him. He took them wordlessly but seemed to relax, and after putting them on he helped us put the large fan we got from the receptionist in front of the window. We all went to bed and I had a surprisingly good sleep. My socks were gone forever, but I couldn't care less. Always bring gifts I guess.;If you work with people's data in any form, it's very easy nowadays to make mistakes regarding data privacy. At the health insurance fund I worked at as a counselor, it was for example strictly forbidden to communicate any document via a way that was not previously 'confirmed' by the client on a paper form, or via a platform that used Itsme. Of course, there are good reasons for such a rule, but it became a bit embarrassing when it prevented people from helping their sick co-workers or even loved ones by slowing down the whole bureacratic process yet again, even more so when these people really were dependent on the allowance they ought to receive from the fund. This is a rule I have made mistakes against once or twice. Maybe you would object against calling it a mistake, as I was not entirely unaware of the fact that I was breaking the rule, but the sense of absurdity of refusing people help because of some data law weighed much harder than this back-of-my-head awareness. Of course it's important to never share any medical or financial data via a dubious way, but I hope that an increase in regulation does not distract us too much from the human side, especially in a world that already poses enough obstacles for those who are less able.

When I started working in a hotel kitchen a few years ago, I soon noticed that there was a certain tension in the kitchen when a particular staff member was rostered in. This quirky woman in her fifties was chaotic, often doing five things at the same time without finishing any, chattering away with guests when there was work to be done. Her behaviour frustrated the other personnel, so they put her on the dishes which forced her to keep her mind to one thing, which in turn infuriated her.

20;In my current job, chaos and things going wrong are the norm. I am a host of cocktail workshops, and if working in the service industry teaches you one thing, it's that you should never underestimate the extent to which a customer can test you patience. We work with a very strict schedule, leaving no time between groups. Recently, one group arrived late, 15 minutes to be exact, having only booked an hour long slot. They spent the following 15 minutes complaining about how their experience would be rushed, and about the selection of cocktails, which they demanded to be able to alter, but which has been set by the manager with whom they made the appointment in advance. After assuaging the guests to the extent I could manage, I proposed them a different cocktail menu that would adapt to their preferences, and would require minimal work in changing the setup that had been prepared for them on my part. To make sure the previous group didn't have to suffer from this group's tardiness and general lack of decorum, I got the instructions for the workshop out of the way in the remaining time allotted to us, and then opened up the courtyard (usually not open to guests), so they could finish their drinks at their leisure without encumbering other guests any further.;The mistakes I make are most frequently attributed to a single but persistent character flaw of mine, which is my tendency to take on too much at once. I let my ambition and lofty goals get the best of me, and stretch myself thinner than I should, only to be met with the mental and physical ramifications further down the road. Strange as it may sound, I've learned to trust my own judgement less, but in a measured way. When I have a big task of project to tackle, I draft a plan, and knowing my tendency to get myself into a pinch, I double or triple the time allotted to each step of the plan. More often than not, what seems at first like a gross overestimation ends up being the gateway to a nice, sustainable working pace.;Yet again, I'd like to refer to my current job, as the role I fulfill is a leading one, in a sense. I have to set the pace of the workshops that people take at our establishment, balancing education and entertainment, all while keeping to a schedule. I've found that, though perhaps it might seem less productive in the moment, that extra time spent on giving clear and extensive instructions before embarking on the task at hand usually saves time in the long run. While an exhaustive explanation might take more time initially, trying to cut corners by being overly concise ends up being a costly mistake, as I might have to repeat instructions not twice, not thrice, but sometimes even four or five times.;1.0;0.01;0.88;0.69;0.03;43.0;In my current job, chaos and things going wrong are the norm.

21;I went to the army, and there, it was forbidden to have any piercings aside from the two standard lobe earrings. I really wanted to have something done because sometimes I feel the need to feel in control by being slightly self-destructive. Therefore, I went on a whim and scheduled an appointment to have my belly button pierced since that was the only way to fulfill my pending desire and not get in trouble with the authorities. this resulted in some discomfort throughout the healing process as the uniform pants were uncomfortable over the area, and I failed to account for the cleaning and caring period that I had to do while on the job. However, given the opportunity I would make the same choice as it is the best decision given the circumstances.;me, my mother, and my little sister wanted to book a trip to France in the summer. After booking flights, accommodations, and attractions (the core of the trip was Disneyland, of course) a few months in advance, we let it go, knowing we had the majority of the preparations done. at some point, I received emails from the airline regarding registration, which I disregarded as promotional material. until at some point, I received a 'thank you for flying with us' email - at which point it dawned on me. I have booked the flight on the wrong date, which has indeed passed. I called my mother crying and apologizing, to which she replied with, 'Mistakes happen, we can't do anything about it' and asked me to rebook the flight to the correct date. after that incident, I triple-check every date and location of the reservation, preferably asking a third-party to review it as well.;we had to do a group project for a class in linguistics fieldwork, and i chose to do it with my best friend there. however, we were 6 people so the teacher decided to split everyone into 2 groups - resulting in a group of 3 people. so, we had to include another person and chose the other Russian-speaking student (as we both do). now, me and my friend are close so we had no issues communicating and collaborating like we always do. but the other student was pretty distant and it was difficult to advance the project. I had to take the initiative and talk to him to do his part as we were approaching the deadline. I realized that not only do I dislike waiting for someone to do their job during a different schedule than my own, but I also do not like when the performance is not up to the way I would have done it.

22;A couple months ago I bought a cheap Gameboy game at a garage sale which I wanted to play on my dad's old Gameboy. The Gameboy had probably not been used for over a decade and when I tried to boot it up, it would not turn on. I did not want to buy another one just to play a single game. Thus, even though I had absolutely zero experience when it came to fixing electronics, I decided to try fixing it myself. I spent my next Saturday looking up information on forums and watching YouTube videos to get more information on the subject and after disassembling the Gameboy, I figured out that the problem was some corrosion damage on the motherboard. This ended up being a pretty simple fix for which I just needed some vinegar and rubbing alcohol. Nonetheless, I felt pretty proud when the Gameboy worked again and am planning to learn how to solder soon to fix more complex problems in the future. I am not sure if this counts as a 'creative' solution, but it was a great example of a problem outside of my comfort zone and it showed me that tackling those problems is a great opportunity to learn new skills.;When I was a kid I used to participate in a lot of chess tournaments. I would perform really well in the smaller tourneys and often win trophies, but when it came to the more important ones, such as regional or national tournaments, I would often get stressed about performing well enough and put too much pressure on myself to win. Of course, this had a negative effect on how I played during those tournaments. After a while I did not look forward toward my chess matches as much as I used to. It was at that point that I realised that the most important thing about a hobby is to enjoy yourself instead of always trying to succeed. Since then, I always prioritised having fun with my hobbies, which includes chess, and it also caused me to pick up more hobbies and skills because it no longer bothered me if I made mistakes or was bad at them when I just started. Usually, by not putting too much pressure on yourself to avoid failure, you will gradually start to improve anyway since you will spend more time on a hobby when you enjoy it more. A little pressure/stress can help to motivate you, but you should never go overboard.;I have not needed to lead a group of people to work together before. However, I have often worked with a group of people and in those situations I tend to try and take the initiative if no one else feels inclined to do so. I will usually be the first to plan a date for us to meet up on, or will help with dividing any work we need to do in an equal manner. There was also an occasion in high school when me and the other students in my English seminar had to help with planning the activities for the trip to London for our year. After we had all finished our work, a few people needed to help present the finished plan to both the students and their parents. The majority of the group did not want to do it, so I volunteered since I did not mind it and it seemed like a good opportunity to improve my public speaking. To conclude, in a group setting, I like to try and help make sure that everything goes smoothly.;0.79;0.38;0.49;0.52;0.5;95.0;A couple months ago I bought a cheap Gameboy game at a garage sale which I wanted to play on my dad's old Gameboy.

24;I find it difficult to remember specific cases of urgency where I was deprived of the usual resolvative means. A few months ago however, I needed to cycle to a train station ca. 10 kilometres from my home to catch a train. It's my usual stroll, but I left earlier than on a regular day. So I decided to take the long way round, cycling through a forest which - while being a detour - was according to my grandmother a faster way to the station. In normal conditions it's connection mainly existing of dirt roads till the nearby town center without any significant traffic.   First I did not have much of luck, the dirt road was unstable due to rain. With a big drive on my wheels, I managed to get through till I reached the centre of a forest consisting mainly of pine trees and sand dunes. There I stumbled on foresters cutting trees who blocked the entire road, and their vehicles also cut off any sidepaths. I looked for any path out. I tried getting through the thick shrubbery, but that was impassible. And going back was almost not an option, I needed to catch my train. The only way was up! Up the sand dune, but biking there was not an option because I kept slipping away. Like a professional cyclist I carried my heavy bike up my sholders till I reached the top of the dune.   However, when I got there, the other side of the dune was blocked by a big wooden fence. Only people on foot could easily pass it. I tried to get my bike through the pedestrian hatch, but it was not possible. Time was ticking, so I threw my bike over the fence. There I discovered that on the other side there was a natural/cultural heritage site which had been damaged by other bikers, which was the cause of the fence. To not damage the heritage, I carried my bike on my sholder down. In the end getting just in time in the station. Arriving simultaniously.   What I learned there is that you have to look for what your environment offers and limits when getting a solution. There was a way out, but I had to reason fast to reach my goals.;When I was in high school I had to speech in front of 200 kids. This was to introduce them to the Student Council. However, I barely prepared this. No idea of what I was going to say or do.   So I had to leave class earlier to get to the big room full of potential new students. When I arrived there the doors were locked. It hit me that the principal and I did not talk about how I should get in. I heard them calling my name, while I was stuck behind the door. I knocked on the door so that they would notice that they forgot to leave it open for me. When I finally got in, there was something else I did not know. How the hell should I go on the stage? There were stairs, but they did not have a straightforward path to the backstage. So I tried to climb through a plant that was standing on stage. For clarification, the plant was standing on the side of the stage where the stairs were, so I just thought it blocked the usual enterance.   So I was there on the stage, but did not know what to say. I tried to be funny, like a stand up comedian, but all my bad takes fell on deaf ears. I started to explain what the Student Council was doing, but kept repeating the same stuff and was not coherent. The students in the room were chuckleing and laughing at my performance of unprepairedness. Finally I left the stage, while the next teacher passsed me and made remarks of mild dissapointment.   In the end, it was the best thing that could ever happen to me. Before all this I had major presentation anxiety. I often turned blue and shaked uncontrollably. After this, it was all gone. All of those things that went wrong in the moment, did not matter in the bigger picture. People did not mind that I failed there as a junior student, it was understandable in that moment. The students even loved it, having comments for the remainder of my high school carreer about the speech.   If I had prepared myself a bit more and stayed true to myself I could have made a better performance and it wouldn't have costed me a lot more of my time. Having fear for presenting stuff was not necessary, because mistakes happen all the time and with a bit more preparation I could've easily managed to fill in blank spots. I learned that with subtle changes, I could be flexible. I just needed to try stuff and dare to take the stage. And I did, participating more and taking the lead in conversations. Failing is often not that bad, if it is not with ill-intent off course. To prevent more logistic failures in the future, like the door or stage enterance, the realization came that communication with higher up was key.;Once upon a time I had to create a guided tour through a Greek city I had never been before for an university course.   We were assigned a group of four, but the other students in my group were work students who did not expect to take the lead in the group. So we devided the tasks with me as a main spokesperson for the group because I was always present. Two people, nice people by the way, wanted to do it on their own terms and only communicate through mail. This was not handy, but I complied because resistance to their stance was futile and wouldn't benefit our end goal.  I said that we all should look for city highlights and list them, and I would make a tour and devide the different stops among all students to give a little talk. Not only this, but because the larger group had someone with a mobile disability  - in a not so equipped city - we needed to make sure that our route was accessible for all. Everyone had to make their own texts which would be checked by the other group members two weeks in advance. This to encourage an early start to the project and a sense of individual and shared responsibility. In a shared document we could leave remarks and tips for eachother, which was faster than sending an endless stream of mails. And we made sure that we encorporated a few themes throughout our tour.  While there were some difficulties due to certain wants, needs and differences in schedule, we managed to find multiple ways to keep the conversation going. There was a certain speed, ease of communication among the group members that was kept with respect to eachothers situation. The only thing I would do different now is to communicate more with the other groups in parallel. Some groups wanted to do the same landmarks and we missed a major one because the communication between the other groups lacked. But internally we managed to figure out what was optimal for us, which gained a more than decent urban tour in the end.;0.67;0.94;0.41;1.0;0.4;91.0;I find it difficult to remember specific cases of urgency where I was deprived of the usual resolvative means.

Not only this, but because the larger group had someone with a mobile disability  - in a not so equipped city - we needed to make sure that our route was accessible for all. Everyone had to make their own texts which would be checked by the other group members two weeks in advance. This to encourage an early start to the project and a sense of individual and shared responsibility. In a shared document we could leave remarks and tips for eachother, which was faster than sending an endless stream of mails. And we made sure that we encorporated a few themes throughout our tour.  While there were some difficulties due to certain wants, needs and differences in schedule, we managed to find multiple ways to keep the conversation going. There was a certain speed, ease of communication among the group members that was kept with respect to eachothers situation. The only thing I would do different now is to communicate more with the other groups in parallel. Some groups wanted to do the same landmarks and we missed a major one because the communication between the other groups lacked. But internally we managed to figure out what was optimal for us, which gained a more than decent urban tour in the end.;0.231;-0.2083;0.8027;-0.2534;-0.2285;-0.2346;-0.03455;-0.039;-0.386;-1.311;0.3984;0.1464;-1.035;0.7856;-0.865;0.02072;0.3547;0.0408;0.1477;-0.2416;-0.0376;0.3704;0.58;-0.6514;0.1696;-0.2383;-0.4346;0.0824;-0.6587;-0.2769;0.2247;0.1514;-0.3513;0.2651;0.3845;0.05807;-0.4392;-0.264;-0.637;0.9194;-0.2163;0.06396;0.6533;-0.385;-0.10803;-0.4907;-0.854;0.3162;-0.2428;0.3823;-0.0636;0.4895;-0.1969;-0.1785;0.1285;-0.41;-0.08026;-0.02415;-0.32;-0.204;-0.1962;-0.4756;0.01028;-0.4333;-0.4907;0.284;0.602;0.101;0.0113;0.6035;-0.7925;-0.666;1.302;1.021;0.0825;-0.46;0.2876;-0.1945;0.463;-0.09686;0.3215;0.541;-0.3115;-0.1385;-0.5894;-0.309;-0.1376;-0.172;0.467;0.3489;0.408;0.1816;-0.1453;0.4124;0.04977;0.624;0.379;0.1877;4.312;1.069;-0.03035;0.05716;-0.424;0.3652;0.5244;-0.9814;0.449;-0.0947;0.0837;0.219;0.897;-0.2834;0.594;-0.1819;0.2485;-0.0798;-0.0203;-0.04056;0.8613;-0.698;0.585;-0.3723;1.095;0.379;-0.05978;-0.253;0.1685;-0.3232;0.1587;-0.8867;-0.0784;-0.06494;0.567;-0.04324;-0.397;0.2488;0.2786;0.0702;-0.5273;0.3516;0.01388;-0.9414;-0.05847;-0.04767;-0.3857;1.879;-0.3887;0.2725;-0.492;-0.0888;0.2042;0.00659;-0.501;0.2212;-0.341;0.0018635;-0.292;-0.10077;0.453;0.3486;-0.7705;-0.2651;-0.8584;1.176;-0.0936;-0.3125;-0.6626;-0.4458;-0.1833;0.02039;-0.431;-0.51;-1.788;0.6255;0.635;-0.05405;-0.4924;0.2421;-0.2207;0.4482;0.1943;0.3784;0.3127;-0.03156;-0.112;0.3708;0.3542;0.215;0.3147;0.692;0.3044;-0.879;0.3152;0.5674;0.727;-0.00984;0.1979;-0.3533;0.584;0.9536;-0.2378;0.06076;-0.2186;0.3372;0.683;0.403;-0.507;-0.391;-0.2102;0.4082;0.11566;0.11707;0.0317;-0.179;0.103;-0.01035;-0.11383;-0.8604;0.4663;-0.2223;0.0822;0.05957;-0.1063;0.3018;0.11475;0.1967;0.2195;-0.781;0.0477;-0.833;-0.07874;0.3928;-0.098;-0.2289;0.0443;0.6416;-0.1903;-0.6406;-0.197;0.3494;0.1582;-0.4197;0.2294;-0.1318;-0.1594;0.2954;-0.3972;0.2148;-0.2069;-0.2223;0.754;0.5117;0.1921;-0.3542;-0.994;0.1351;0.1572;-0.503;-0.651;-0.3665;0.518;-3.002;0.11115;-0.212;0.624;-0.00541;-0.4397;-0.0889;0.004944;-0.3735;-0.2422;0.5425;-0.3684;-0.00673;-0.1298;0.4246;-0.1517;0.0997;-0.3643;0.11096;-0.2913;0.211;0.1405;0.495;0.4202;-0.0692;-0.09973;-0.05826;0.1333;2.607;0.835;0.2747;-0.1769;0.1223;0.1309;0.0693;-0.834;-0.5977;0.1638;-0.5566;0.4705;-0.2812;-0.1935;-0.4026;-0.6196;0.467;-0.7007;0.1019;-1.299;0.2917;-0.1344;0.11255;0.3896;0.0529;-0.7383;-0.152;0.3574;0.4255;0.511;-0.386;-0.4321;-0.1697;0.1021;-0.2056;0.06076;-0.6387;-0.956;-0.943;-0.6523;-0.2646;-0.647;-0.1836;0.0638;0.01794;-0.256;-0.4001;-0.09796;0.2161;-0.812;0.4487;-0.1342;-0.58;-0.1115;0.9473;0.2491;-0.343;0.601;-0.8145;-0.2578;0.4175;-0.2903;0.2805;0.3865;-0.4722;-0.08075;-0.513;0.1539;-0.0584;0.2534;-1.3;0.525;-1.637;0.515;0.4453;0.1279;0.2084;-0.506;-0.679;-0.1223;0.2303;0.2107;-0.0412;-0.3315;0.1533;-0.2917;0.2754;0.4683;0.57;0.1265;-0.7134;-0.823;-0.2096;-0.433;0.1218;0.02066;0.1736;-0.07495;-0.4067;0.415;-0.4338;0.0755;-0.59;0.1633;0.2162;0.4534;-0.799;0.3647;0.2974;0.2664;-0.7407;-0.05154;0.719;-0.02548;-0.3518;-0.6846;-0.3975;-0.05844;0.372;-1.482;-0.2068;0.1481;0.1715;0.10974;0.5186;-0.69;-0.2129;0.5083;0.4543;-0.0969;1.043;0.1042;0.3103;-0.2466;-0.091;-0.0682;1.262;0.3994;-0.3704;-0.3713;0.09375;-0.724;-0.5156;-0.6006;-0.0615;-0.2489;0.2285;0.08527;-0.557;0.4143;3.947;-0.4856;0.1214;0.3225;-0.1973;-0.09973;-0.288;-0.1918;1.085;-0.704;0.002834;0.2349;0.459;0.4438;-0.1489;-0.2051;-0.1617;-0.1417;-0.48;-0.4731;0.6577;0.707;0.4058;-0.0663;0.3386;0.02394;0.1753;0.04575;-0.03967;0.04794;-0.1009;0.66;1.06;0.1882;0.4116;-0.5454;0.00911;-0.0393;0.2852;0.5356;0.3164;0.4822;0.6113;0.2269;-0.02779;-0.05817;0.4272;0.4058;0.5107;-0.532;-0.04;0.1353;0.588;0.02502;-0.04398;-0.206;0.3079;-0.2181;0.4763;0.10535;0.1447;-0.1787;-0.1995;0.6475;0.1356;-0.686;0.787;-0.591;-0.4792;0.08545;-0.5264;-0.2075;-0.634;0.4668;0.1497;0.3625;-1.109;0.2734;0.342;-0.3208;-0.02835;-0.5894;0.4707;-0.3389;-0.3193;-0.1909;-0.472;-1.369;-1.038;-0.4954;0.9326;-0.10547;-0.3804;0.2368;0.00581;-0.1509;-0.05612;-0.1669;0.0463;0.7407;0.0536;0.396;1.244;-0.671;-0.5273;0.29;1.168;0.2725;-0.02303;0.5474;0.2418;0.5522;-0.2493;0.261;0.1987;-0.1354;-0.06616;-0.6494;-5.95;0.0603;0.08795;-0.2048;-0.2125;-0.2852;-0.1066;-0.3252;0.2432;0.4304;-0.3455;-0.2008;-1.111;0.1337;0.01479;0.0251;-0.2507;-0.4043;0.3628;0.11664;-0.305;-0.02907;0.0905;-0.2336;-0.10693;-0.646;0.1128;-0.421;0.1164;0.38;-0.2021;-0.2406;0.417;0.1609;-0.2401;0.3306;-0.0316;-0.0532;0.1626;0.3052;0.2054;-0.4644;-0.2164;0.2666;-1.266;-0.357;-0.1378;-1.74;0.10974;-0.235;-0.153;-0.3733;-0.372;-0.4753;-0.1093;-0.375;-0.145;0.3142;0.4668;-0.5015;0.02937;-0.06604;0.6323;-0.453;0.319;0.062;-0.646;-0.2578;-0.2764;0.1686;-0.3865;-0.461;-0.1873;0.3032;-0.06128;0.2979;0.366;0.192;1.653;0.3142;-0.42;-0.9487;0.1556;-0.2776;-0.689;-0.2717;-0.11646;-0.1895;-0.817;0.4263;-0.07916;-0.523;-0.3037;-0.1552;0.3945;-0.2091;-0.5312;-0.1599;0.0935;-0.842;0.02505;-0.4453;-0.02031;0.05148;0.738;0.7744;2.312;-1.125;-0.01996;-0.0348;0.531;-0.4482;-0.2947;0.1615;1.681;0.6953;0.1576;0.4438;-0.0635;-0.0769;-0.242;0.72

27;In secondary school, we did a three-day school excursion to the rural countryside, where all girls spent an evening in the woods together to observe the nightly wildlife. During this walk through the dense and dark forest, a friend of mine fell awkwardly and dislocated her knee. Us being located in the middle of the forest where no car could get to, and none of us being able to carry her on our back, me and some other girls came up with the idea of how to carry her out. We worked in pairs, where we held hands with crossed arms, creating a sort of chair with our hands for my hurt friend to sit on. We all took turns carrying her, and walked our way back out of the forest, which took us a couple of hours. Once back into the little town, she was finally able to be driven to the hospital, while my friend and I who shared a room with her packed her bags, and said our goodbyes to her. I'll never forget that evening, and it definitely brought the three of us closer...;Perhaps not a real failure or mistake, but more something I 'gave up on'. I've always been anxious in the car, and when I started lessons for my driver's license, I couldn't bring myself to practice on my own. I was too anxious to drive on my own, and having one of my parents in the car with me only caused more tension, which resulted in me getting more and more anxious to drive a car. I left it alone for 3 years, after which I felt more encouraged, and decided to pick it back up. I had to take lessons again, but it got me over my fear, and I got my license after my first driving test. I never would have thought I would be able to get my license, and even more so after my first try. I learned from this whole experience that it is okay to let something rest for a while, and that it is not necessarily giving up, but more like not forcing myself to do something I'm not up for at the moment. For me, letting something rest for a while was the right thing to do, and I need to give myself some peace when facing my fears, instead of putting more pressure on myself...;In my second year of university, we had to do a group project, where the groups were already assigned to us. Each one of us (we were 5 in total), had to  discuss a trend in a certain literary work. In general it went pretty good, but one team member kept making excuses of why they hadn't done anything yet. Only a day before the deadline, they started their work, and as was to be expected, they failed. However, since only the final grade (all individual scores added up) counted for all of us, we all failed, even though individually we (the other team members) passed, because of that one member we didn't get over 50% of the points, and everyone had to redo their work... it was a real bummer, and it made me realize that I need to be more vocal when I see someone is slacking off, especially if the end result affects the whole team.;0.15;0.7;0.41;0.81;0.84;95.0;In secondary school, we did a three-day school excursion to the rural countryside, where all girls spent an evening in the woods together to observe the nightly wildlife.

29;When I was chairman of a student club, there was a given point when the person who was responsible for organization of an event forgot one of the key elements of that event. We were supposed to do a cheese and wine evening, everything was in order, from the bread to the cheese to the wine. One of the most important elements of that evening, which was not yet fixed, was the location. The responsible person notified me the day this event was supposed to take place, which was on a Sunday. Without a location, the event would fail completely. In that instance, I used my connection and reputation that I have, and I called someone and pleaded if we could use his location. This was tricky because it was too late for him to find personnel to supervise the event, and therefore I had to plead that I was very responsible and that I would ensure that everything would be cleaned and in its place after the event. By doing this, I was able to save an event that otherwise would have not been able to go through.;One of the biggest mistakes that I made happened during the same function as in the previous question. As the chairman of the student club, I always felt a great deal of responsibility. Because I was the final person who was responsible, I felt like I should always keep control. As leadership of this club, we were a team of three people. While both were competent and in no sense lazy, I did feel that I was supposed to be the one who was in control and ended up doing all the work. This kept on going for quite a while. My school results started to go down, and my personal life slowly stared to become nonexistent. When finally my body physically started to fail as well, I finally reached the breaking point.  What I learned from this experience is that while it is always good to believe in yourself, you should always keep in mind where your limits are and be ready to ask for help when you need it. There is no shame in asking for help, and sometimes it is even necessary. I learned to safeguard my personal boundaries better and learned to figure out my priorities.;As chairman of the student club, leading a team was what was expected from my position. Leading a diverse group of people learned me many things. One of the biggest things I learned was that each has their own abilities and strengths. I had members in my team who needed only one question, and they went to work. They would do their own work very well without needing a lot of follow up. The problem here was that as individuals, they worked very well on their own, but lacked team spirit. On the other hand, there were people who worked very well as a team, but they needed a lot of guidance, and it was necessary for me to follow up their work, or it would not be done. The combination of these two types did create situations where I and my two other colleagues of the leadership had to step in and do extra work.  Eventually, the vice-chairman and I learned that we should tend more to the personal needs of the team in combination of the needs of the team as a whole. By encouraging the people who needed guidance and having the individuals tell the group more about their personal work we ensured that productivity increased and that we were able to organize a broad scale of events with which we were able to make a great amount of people happy.;0.9;0.38;0.62;0.97;0.72;83.0;When I was chairman of a student club, there was a given point when the person who was responsible for organization of an event forgot one of the key elements of that event.

30;I am organising a surprise party for my mother in the upcoming month and the invitee list is quite long. Mailing invitations are a thing of the past and I am not fond of making groupchats to communicate the details of the event as they have proven to be not very useful in the past, and frankly, that is a bit impersonal. Not only am I not comfortable calling 70+ people, I simply also couldn't fit it in my schedule. The age range is also quite big, not everyone remembers everything correctly, etc. My biggest problem: I cannot ask for people to buy a gift (while I do expect it). So my solution was to create a jazzy invitation on Canva with all the details: date, location, dress code, what time guests should be arriving and what time my mother would arrive, and lastly gift ideas. I simply put some pictograms so the options seem broad but also not demanding. Texting everyone a picture of an invitation made my job as organiser a lot easier and less time-consuming.;"When I was 17, I was panicking about what I should study at university. I had a big A0 sheet on my bedroom wall with all the possible majors I could study, each accompanied with a pros and cons list. Well, when I finally enrolled in college, I chose something completely different from my ""major"" in high school. I went from STEM to Humanities, much to my family's dismay. And I failed that year. I struggled too much with college life. So I moved back home and enrolled in college there. This time I chose for something that I knew I was skilled in: sciences. But then the pandemic rolled around and I realised that still wasn't what I wanted to do. Though I was skilled enough (and got better grades), my passion was in the Humanities.

31;The issue was that the team I worked in did not have any proper cover art for the magazine one day before the final deadline. My coworker, who had been in charge of delegating tasks to others,  could not help out as she was fully booked with other engagements. I assume she hd forgotten to ask anyone specifically to make the cover art and the rest of the team that was in charge of the final arrangement, had tried to make a cover based on another drawing in the magazine but remained unhappy with the result. They then asked me to help out. The problem was that there was only one day for me to make a cover, which was not supposed to be my responsibility otherwise, so I tried to tink of a solution that would be quick and easy but would still look good. In the end, I combined multiple drawings from articles together and added some extra details to make a coherent whole image. This has taught me that it is important to communicate with the rest of the team that you work with, especially when one of the members is struggling with their tasks.;There was an instance when I was asked by a coworker to change something on the backend of the website in order to give that coworker the correct credits for a photo. However, when my coworker asked this of me in a message, I did not understand the message to be about photos and assumed she made a mistake in thinking it was my responsibility. As I did not understand what was being asked of me, I told the coworker to ask another person, who I thought was responsible for managing the credit of the articles on the website. Later on, this other person came forward to discuss this issue with me and as she explained what needed to be changed I also realised that that changing the credit (in this case) was my responsibility. I apologised to this other person for the confusion and changed the credits on the website accordingly. This mistake has taught me that if I should not be to quick to think other people have made a mistake. If I am unsure about what is being asked of me, I should ask for clarification instead of pushing the problem onto someone else.;There was an instance when a group of friends that I am a part of wanted to buy a birthday present for one of the friends in the group. This idea had been mentioned before, but no one took up charge in order to decide what we would be getting for our friend. As I became fed up having to wait while the birthday waas coming closer, I chose to take charge instead. I restarted the conversation in the group chat to give ideas for presents and lead the group into choosing an appropriate present. I then also delligated which members of the group would be buying which parts of the gift and checked in at later times to see if they had done their part. The biggest issue I encountered was getting started. Despite knowing that I do well when I am in charge of a group, I usually prefer to avoid the conflict of choosing who will be in charge and also prefer to give that role to whoever want it most.;1.0;0.25;0.04;0.9;0.61;74.0;The issue was that the team I worked in did not have any proper cover art for the magazine one day before the final deadline.
