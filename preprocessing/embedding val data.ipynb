Not only am I not comfortable calling 70+ people, I simply also couldn't fit it in my schedule. The age range is also quite big, not everyone remembers everything correctly, etc. My biggest problem: I cannot ask for people to buy a gift (while I do expect it). So my solution was to create a jazzy invitation on Canva with all the details: date, location, dress code, what time guests should be arriving and what time my mother would arrive, and lastly gift ideas. I simply put some pictograms so the options seem broad but also not demanding. Texting everyone a picture of an invitation made my job as organiser a lot easier and less time-consuming.\",\n          \"The moment when I recently moved to Belgium while leaving my home country Istanbul was the biggest change for me to take an outside step from my comfort zone.

So as I did like, I give a time for myself to examine, listen and let myself to being part of the community and the environment.

As I did not understand what was being asked of me, I told the coworker to ask another person, who I thought was responsible for managing the credit of the articles on the website. Later on, this other person came forward to discuss this issue with me and as she explained what needed to be changed I also realised that that changing the credit (in this case) was my responsibility. I apologised to this other person for the confusion and changed the credits on the website accordingly.

At the health insurance fund I worked at as a counselor, it was for example strictly forbidden to communicate any document via a way that was not previously 'confirmed' by the client on a paper form, or via a platform that used Itsme. Of course, there are good reasons for such a rule, but it became a bit embarrassing when it prevented people from helping their sick co-workers or even loved ones by slowing down the whole bureacratic process yet again, even more so when these people really were dependent on the allowance they ought to receive from the fund. This is a rule I have made mistakes against once or twice. Maybe you would object against calling it a mistake, as I was not entirely unaware of the fact that I was breaking the rule, but the sense of absurdity of refusing people help because of some data law weighed much harder than this back-of-my-head awareness. Of course it's important to never share any medical or financial data via a dubious way, but I hope that an increase in regulation does not distract us too much from the human side, especially in a world that already poses enough obstacles for those who are less able.

Most of our closing tasks had been done and it was finally almost time to go home when I dropped a full rack of glasses in my fatigued rush to get home quickly.  Had I taken my time to see it through patiently OR decided not tot spread myself as thin this mistake could've been easily avoided.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Q3\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 29,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"There was an instance when a group of friends that I am a part of wanted to buy a birthday present for one of the friends in the group. This idea had been mentioned before, but no one took up charge in order to decide what we would be getting for our friend. As I became fed up having to wait while the birthday waas coming closer, I chose to take charge instead. I restarted the conversation in the group chat to give ideas for presents and lead the group into choosing an appropriate present. I then also delligated which members of the group would be buying which parts of the gift and checked in at later times to see if they had done their part. The biggest issue I encountered was getting started. Despite knowing that I do well when I am in charge of a group, I usually prefer to avoid the conflict of choosing who will be in charge and also prefer to give that role to whoever want it most.\",\n          \"I'm not someone who will quickly take on a leader role, so I wouldn't be able to describe such a situation. However, I like to think that my presence on the side might be helpful as well to get a group of people to work together as a team.   When I started working in a hotel kitchen a few years ago, I soon noticed that there was a certain tension in the kitchen when a particular staff member was rostered in. This quirky woman in her fifties was chaotic, often doing five things at the same time without finishing any, chattering away with guests when there was work to be done. Her behaviour frustrated the other personnel, so they put her on the dishes which forced her to keep her mind to one thing, which in turn infuriated her. When she was collecting used coffee grounds which she would take home to grow mushrooms on, the rest made fun of her. Bad vibe.  When I was working, I tried to calm the tempers. When others were making nasty comments behind her back, I tried to rephrase their - usually justified - frustrations in a constructive way to her: I pointed out things she had forgotten with a wink. I also set aside used coffee grounds for her, so she wouldn't lose time with it, and so it became less something to be made fun of. When rush hour was over and only two people had to stay, I volunteered to stay with her. During those hours I actually got to know her as a sweet bookish woman talking passionately about her heroes Rutger Bregman and Angela Merkel, about which I later spoke admiringly to the rest. I like to think that because of my minor efforts she got more at ease and more agreeable to work with, which in turn was appreciated by the rest, who might have discovered they were treating her wrongly.\",\n          \"I was on the board as secretary (and later HR officer) of a student association for quite some time. We organised multiple activities every month with a relatively minor budget, which was quite stressful at times. The largest issues we encountered, however, were interpersonal ones: many of our team truly struggled to work together because of everything from useless drama to clashing personalities. It often irritated me greatly that others lacked the maturity to put aside personal differences to work together as a team, but then realised irritation is not the best headspace to approach that from. I quickly learned an understanding an compassionate attitude, while way more effort, gets better results. It has always and probably will always be easier for me to work together with people with similar mindsets to me, but nowadays I'm quite good at feigning whatever I need to get a decent end result. In the end we had many succesful activities and our association truly made a lot of connections possible between members.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\":
